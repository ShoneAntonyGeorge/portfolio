            Since the students I was training were from another country with 2hrs 30mins time difference 
            I had to go to work early morning. Both these factors made it challenging and really pushed me 
            and made me realize the depth of my abilities. Some of the topics were not familiar to me and 
            had to be looked through the night before and teach them the next morning. Overall I was satisfied 
            with how things came out. Made the experience more sweet by students reaching out 
            after the course was over to thank me.`,

            everyone involved within the organization was quite understanding and allowed me to take my own time 
            to get to the pace that was needed. On top of that I was also able to receive valuable guidance and 
            knowledge since they possessed multiple decades of experience working with various fields of 
            computer science. It pretty much shaped who I am as a developer today. Initially worked with many programming languages 
            being able to manage many but not master any, I finally found myself working and mastering Javascript/Typescript.`,
