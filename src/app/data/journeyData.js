            Since the students I was training were from another country with a 2 hour 30 minute time difference, I had to begin work early in the morning.
            Both of these factors made the experience challenging and really pushed me, helping me realize the depth of my abilities.
            Some of the topics were unfamiliar to me, so I spent the nights before studying them and teaching the material the next morning.
            Overall, I was satisfied with how everything turned out.
            What made the experience even more rewarding was the students reaching out after the course to thank me personally.`,

            Everyone involved within the organization was quite understanding and allowed me to take my own time 
            to get to the pace that was needed. On top of that I was also able to receive valuable guidance and 
            knowledge since they possessed multiple decades of experience working with various fields of 
            computer science. It pretty much shaped who I am as a developer today. Initially worked with many programming languages
