        description:`The journey began one day in 8th grade when I heard an announcement about an HTML competition at school. Confused about what HTML even meant, I started self-learning HTML and CSS. That curiosity turned into passion, leading me to earn top grades and place as high as 3rd multiple times in district-level interschool web design competitions. Eventually, it all culminated in earning my degree in Computer Science.`,

        description:`I started the work on short notice — the day after I was informed I got the job.
            Since the students I was training were from another country with a 2 hour 30 minute time difference, I had to begin work early in the morning.
            Both of these factors made the experience challenging and really pushed me, helping me realize the depth of my abilities.
            Some of the topics were unfamiliar to me, so I spent the nights before studying them and teaching the material the next morning.
            Overall, I was satisfied with how everything turned out.
            What made the experience even more rewarding was the students reaching out after the course to thank me personally.`,

            Everyone in the organization was incredibly understanding, allowing me the time I needed to adjust and get up to speed.
            On top of that, I received valuable guidance and insight from team members with decades of experience across various areas of computer science.
            This experience played a major role in shaping who I am as a developer today.
